# Mini Scheme
My toy implementation of a Scheme like programming language written in TypeScript. This project was greatly inspired by the books The Little Schemer and The Seasoned Schemer from Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen and especially because of the cute illustrations of Duane Bibby. I also liked SICP when I read it a few years ago, and always wanted to come up with my own functional something something. 

The most iteresting part, that actually made me to implement this was the `call-with-current-continuation` construct or `call/cc` for short (experienced Lispers and Schemers are now probably banging their heads agains the wall because of not drawing a clear difference between the two). I just wanted to play with this construct a bit so that I understand it better. Also I haven't written an interpreter that supported anything like that before, so it was the best time to start.
